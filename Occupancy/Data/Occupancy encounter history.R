#   BH11 only has 8 b/c AM62 didn't work on this day
#   BH05 only has 8 b/c AM33 is missing the entire Trip 2 (1/18-3/15)

# occupied = NA, open = T, the photos exist but they haven't been looked at
#   This makes sense because I assumed they were all open if they haven't been looked at.
# occupied = NA, open = F, the photos don't exist
# occupied = F, open = T, the camera was open for the week but no elk were detected
# occupied = T, open = T, the camera was open for the week and elk were detected
# occupied = F, open = F, the pictures exist but were censored
# occupied = T, open = F, the pictures exist but were censored but animals were seen anyway
# Neither of the last two exist yet
